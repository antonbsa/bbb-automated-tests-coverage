# BBB automated tests coverage (playwright)

### This repo is used as a basis for counting the coverage of the automated tests (pointing to [v2.4.1](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/tree/v2.4.1))
[Click here](https://github.com/antonbsa/bbb-automated-tests-coverage/issues/1) to see the current status and check the **covered / uncovered** ratio in the "tasks" part of the issue

___

Basically, a count of features was made **by UI location** (like actions bar, settings, etc) and **by feature** (like presentation, connection status, etc) and it has been checked whether there is a test for this or not. This count will be updated as tests are added.

### Questions
  - add specific topic to v2.4 features?
### Stil in testing
  - Runtime screenshots checks
    - the idea is to check some actions that should change the UI. in some cases, just checking for the props element is not enough.
